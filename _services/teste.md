Este projeto foi contemplado pelo edital _Foundational Integrity Research: Misinformation and Polarization request for proposals_, promovido pelo Facebook Research, em 2020. A proposta é liderada pela Diretoria de Análises de Políticas Públicas da Fundação Getulio Vargas (DAPP-FGV) e conta com o coLAB como parceiro interinstitucional.

## Resumo

This research project aims to identify the online distribution network of dangerous political content by radicalized constituencies during the 2020 Brazilian municipal elections. We have assumed that dangerous and uncivil messages based on longitudinal prejudices or latent social anxieties gain greater engagement online, fostering a climate of opinion conducive to the creation and circulation of fake news. Additionally, our second assumption is that the more rooted is the social conviction on untruthful and conspiratorial facts, the more implications dangerous speeches can generate for the distortion of public opinion and for undemocratic behavior of the voter. Based on the mapping of pages and public groups on Brazilian politics with a radicalized bias, ranging from far-right to far-left networks, we propose 1. to monitor the influx of dangerous messages; 2. to detect the most viral dangerous contents; 3. to detect the formation of communities of cohesive interests through which these messages are amplified; and 4. to identify the participation of micro-influencers (ordinary accounts) and macro-influencers (public figures) to foster dangerous arguments and content for the electoral and democratic processes. Thus, the research also aims to analyze the connection of dangerous and hateful speeches with social and political reality.

2. To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.
3. According to the European Accounting Association:

## Relevance

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. 

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. 

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Faithful Representation

The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.

## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

### Comparability

## Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

Cash Inflow | Outflow | Opening Balance
--- | --- | ---
*Monday* | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**
1 | 2 | 3


**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

* Cash inflow: $20
* Cash outflow:$7
* Opening balance: $5
* Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)
The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. 

- **fixed assets**
    - property
    - building
    - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
    - copyrights
    - trademarks
    - patents
        - pending
        - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
