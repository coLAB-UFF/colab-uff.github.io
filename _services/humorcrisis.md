## Resumo

In times of crisis and disaster, new forms of humor emerge. This phenomenon of ?disaster humor? is not new. For instance, there were jokes about the Titanic (1912), about the explosion of the Space Shuttle (1986), about the attacks of September 11th (2001) ? and now there are jokes about the Corona crisis. While it may seem insensitive to make light of such serious matters, such jokes perform useful social functions. For instance, they provide comic relief, allow people to take some distance from the complicated emotions produced by mediated disasters, and help people to bond and seek companionship. As researchers studying humor, we are interested to see what jokes, memes, and other forms of humor people create and share in the current crisis.
